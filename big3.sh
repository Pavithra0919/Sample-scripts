Hereâ€™s a simple shell script to find the largest of three numbers:

Copy the code
#!/bin/bash

# Read three numbers from the user
echo "Enter first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter second number:"
read num2
echo "Enter third number:"
read num3

# Compare the numbers
if [ $num1 -ge $num2 ] && [ $num1 -ge $num3 ]; then
    echo "The largest number is: $num1"
elif [ $num2 -ge $num1 ] && [ $num2 -ge $num3 ]; then
    echo "The largest number is: $num2"
else
    echo "The largest number is: $num3"
fi
